## **Overview**

Dynamic Pattern Alignment (DPA) is a systems-theoretic alignment framework designed to regulate the internal representational dynamics of generative and autonomous AI systems.

Instead of controlling surface-level behavior through rules, filters, or reward shaping, DPA focuses on:

- maintaining **structural plasticity**  
- preventing **pattern rigidity**  
- enabling **internal self-critique**  
- reorganizing internal states via **value gradients**  
- monitoring and moderating **emergent capability growth**  

DPA is model-agnostic and intended for large-scale generative models, future AGI architectures, and agentic AI systems.
