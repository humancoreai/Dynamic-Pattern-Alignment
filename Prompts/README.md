# DPA Prompt Library

This directory contains prompt definitions used as controlled stimuli
for observing alignment dynamics, pattern stability, and rigidity
in large language models.

The prompts are not optimization tricks.
They are experimental inputs designed to provoke specific response behaviors
that can be analyzed using the DPA framework.

Prompts are:
- model-agnostic
- reproducible
- intentionally minimal
- evaluated by observed behavior, not intent

The analysis of responses is handled separately in the `src` modules.
